1. VARIABLES :-

Varibles are used to store different types of values in js
the value can be of any type like string,integer,boolean and many more !

Eg :-

let name = "vinay"
const pi = 3.14
var sum = 3 + 8

# Diff b/w let , var and const :-

1). var : the varible made with var is global scope and functional scope like we can use its value anywhere in code. Cons about it is that we can create the same variable name several times and store different values but js engine will remind only last declared variable (it can create biggest problem in code).

2). let : the variable made with let is block scope. If we assign a variable with let then we could not create the same varible name next time it will through an error .But one thing about this variable is that we can change its value several times .

3). const : the variable made with const is also block scope but we can not change or assign its value because it is constant .

2. DATA-TYPES :-
   8 datatypes in js are :-
   - STRING eg: const name = "Vinay"
   - NUMBER eg:let age = 20
   - BOOLEAN eg: let value = true
   - BigInt. eg: let sum =
   - NULL eg: let name = null
   - UNDEFINED. eg: let val;
   - OBJECTS. eg: let data = { name : "vinay", age :20}
   - ARRAYS. eg: const arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

3. Create an object called student with the following properties:-

4. Find Duplicate Numbers in an Array and Count Them

   Find:
   The duplicate numbers.
   How many times each duplicate number appears.

6. Find Factorial of a Number
   🔹 Task:
   Create a function to find the factorial of a number.
   Example:
